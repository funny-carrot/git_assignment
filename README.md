a. What is an issue?
An issue in GitHub is a fundamental tool used within the platform to track all kinds of work, discussions, and more on a repository. It serves as a collaborative interface where team members, collaborators, or even the public (in open-source projects) can track and discuss individual tasks, enhancements, bugs, or any other activities associated with the development of the project.
b. What is a pull request?
A pull request in GitHub is a key feature used in software development that facilitates collaboration among developers. It allows you to notify others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.
c. Describe the steps to open a pull request?
Step 1: Fork or Clone the Repository
Step 2: Create a New Branch
Step 3: Make Your Changes
Step 4: Commit Your Changes
Step 5: Push Your Branch to GitHub
Step 6: Create the Pull Request
Step 7: Configure the Pull Request
Step 8: Select the Reviewers
Step 9: Create the Pull Request
Step 10: Review and Merge
d. Describe the steps to add a collaborator to a repository 
(share write permissions)
Step 1: Navigate to the Repository
Step 2: Go to the Settings
Step 3: Manage Access
Step 4: Invite Collaborator
Step 5: Collaborator Accepts the Invitation
Step 6: Confirm Access
e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?
Purpose--
Git: A version control system used to manage code history and development locally on your machine.
GitHub: A cloud-based platform for hosting Git repositories and facilitating collaboration.
Usage--
Git: Used through the command line to manage your codebase.
GitHub: Accessed via the web (or through GitHub's desktop applications) to manage repositories, review code, and collaborate with others.
Control--
Git: Decentralized; every user has a complete copy of the repository.
GitHub: Centralized hosting service where repositories are stored online and accessed via the cloud.
f. What does git diff do?
The git diff command in Git is used to show the differences between various states of your repository. It compares two sets of dataâ€”typically changes made in your working directory, staging area, or between different commits, branches, or tags. This command helps you see what has changed in your code, which is particularly useful for reviewing modifications before committing them or understanding the differences between different versions of your files.
g. What is the main branch?
The "main" branch is the central branch in a Git repository where the stable and production-ready code lives. It acts as the foundation for all development and is typically the branch from which new features are branched and into which they are merged once complete. Using and maintaining the main branch effectively is crucial for ensuring code stability and project continuity.
h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?
 While you might push directly to the main branch in specific cases, it's generally best practice to use feature branches and pull requests to manage changes. This approach ensures better code quality, reduces the risk of bugs, and facilitates collaboration, especially in larger teams or projects.
